### Week 1

#### Problem 1: Single Number

Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example 1:

Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4


#### Problem 2: Happy Number
     
 Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".
 
 A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, 
 replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number 
 equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. 
 Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.
 
 Example: 
 
 Input: 19  
 Output: true  
 Explanation:   
 12 + 92 = 82  
 82 + 22 = 68  
 62 + 82 = 100  
 12 + 02 + 02 = 1
